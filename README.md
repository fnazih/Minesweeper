# Minesweeper game
This is an individual school project in Java where I had to code the Minesweeper game. This file explains how to run the game.

### Intro
To run the game, you just open the project on a Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA for example), and run the "Demineur.java" file as the main class.
A pop up tab appears, asking for your name. Your can enter your name, and then press enter.

### How to start
The default game level is EASY, an 8x8 cell grid. You can change level in the menu bar, by clicking the "Change level" menu and then choosing a new level.

### How to play
Left-click a cell to reveal it.
Right-click a cell to flag it.

As soon as you click on the first cell (left or right click), the counter starts, counting the time you spend on the game. Your score (= the number of revealed empty cells) is displayed on the bottom of the panel.
If you reveal a mined cell, a pop up tab appears; telling you that you lost and giving you your final score. You can choose to leave the game, or retry.
